# Jumping-Into-CPlusPlus
"Jumping into C++" book examples, worked through exercises, and notes.

See [the author's website](https://www.cprogramming.com/ "the website") or [the book intro page](https://www.cprogramming.com/c++book/?inl=sample "the book") for more details. I found this book to be quite good. As someone new to C++, it made the language more approachable than other books, yet went into enough detail to really get comfortable with the language. It was also educational on the ins & outs of data structures that I have been missing by coming from higher level languages.

The chapter exercises were also well thought out. A lot were reasonably fast, but some really took some work, and none required much content not adequately covered in the text combined with an occasional Google search. Some also build off each other nicely or nicely compare different implementations of the language.
